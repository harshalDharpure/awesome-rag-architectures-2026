databases shown as geometric cubes, knowledge graphs as illuminated node networks, 
embedding vectors visualized as flowing data streams, modern dark theme background 
with deep navy blue (#0a1929), neon accents in electric blue (#00d4ff) and 
purple (#8b5cf6), clean geometric patterns, tech circuit board aesthetic, 
subtle grid overlay, premium GitHub banner style, wide aspect ratio 3:1,
