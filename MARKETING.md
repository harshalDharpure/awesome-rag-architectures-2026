🚀 Introducing: Awesome RAG Architectures 2025

The ultimate reference for building production RAG systems.

6 battle-tested architectures:
🔄 Multi-Hop RAG
🔍 Hybrid Search RAG  
📚 Long-Context RAG
🤖 Agentic RAG
🕸️ Knowledge Graph RAG
🖼️ Multimodal RAG

100% open source. Zero fluff.

🧵 Thread ↓
```

```
1/ Multi-Hop RAG

For questions requiring multiple documents.

How it works:
→ Initial retrieval
→ LLM analysis
→ Sub-query generation
→ Follow-up retrieval
→ Answer synthesis

Perfect for: Research, analytics, cross-document reasoning

[Include Mermaid diagram image]
```

```
2/ Hybrid Search RAG

BM25 + Vector Search = Superior Retrieval

Results from our benchmarks:
- BM25 alone: 72% recall
- Vector alone: 78% recall
- Hybrid (RRF): 89% recall ✨

[Include comparison chart]
```

[Continue for each architecture...]

```
7/ Everything is:
✅ Production-ready code
✅ Working Jupyter notebooks
✅ Detailed Mermaid diagrams
✅ Performance benchmarks
✅ MIT licensed

Star ⭐ the repo: [link]

Let's make 2025 the year of great RAG systems!
```

### Engagement Posts

```
🤔 Which RAG architecture should you use?

Quick decision guide:

Simple Q&A → Hybrid Search
Complex reasoning → Multi-Hop
Full document analysis → Long-Context
Tool use needed → Agentic
Entity relationships → Knowledge Graph
Images/audio → Multimodal

Full guide: [link]
```

```
📊 RAG Benchmark Results (2025)

Tested 6 architectures on HotpotQA:

| Architecture | Faithfulness | Latency |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Agentic | 94% | 4.2s |
| Long-Context | 95% | 3.5s |
| Multi-Hop | 92% | 2.1s |

### Launch Announcement

```
🎯 Just open-sourced: Awesome RAG Architectures 2025

After 6 months of research and production deployments, I'm sharing the complete guide to modern RAG systems.

What's included:

📚 6 Production Architectures
- Multi-Hop RAG (complex reasoning)
- Hybrid Search (BM25 + vectors)
- Long-Context (100K+ tokens)
- Agentic RAG (autonomous agents)
- Knowledge Graph RAG (structured reasoning)
- Multimodal RAG (images, audio)

🛠️ Working Code
- Python implementations
- Jupyter notebooks
- Utility modules

📊 Benchmarks
- Embedding quality
- Retrieval latency
- RAG evaluation

Why I built this:

I was frustrated with the gap between research papers and production code. Most RAG tutorials show toy examples that fall apart at scale.

This repo bridges that gap with battle-tested patterns from real deployments.

🔗 GitHub: [link]

Who should use this?
→ ML engineers building RAG systems
→ Teams evaluating RAG architectures
→ Anyone wanting to level up their retrieval game

Star it ⭐ if you find it useful!

### Follow-up Posts

```
💡 The biggest mistake I see in RAG implementations:

Using vector search alone.

Here's why hybrid search wins every time:

**Title:** [P] Awesome RAG Architectures 2025 - Complete guide with 6 production patterns

```
Hey r/MachineLearning,

I've been working on RAG systems for the past 2 years and noticed a gap between academic papers and practical implementations.

Today I'm releasing Awesome RAG Architectures 2025 - a comprehensive open-source guide covering:

**6 Architectures:**
- Multi-Hop RAG
- Hybrid Search RAG
- Long-Context RAG
- Agentic RAG
- Knowledge Graph RAG
- Multimodal RAG

**What's included:**
- Full Python implementations
- Interactive notebooks
- Mermaid architecture diagrams
- Performance benchmarks

**Benchmarks (HotpotQA):**
- Best faithfulness: Long-Context (95%)
- Best latency: Hybrid Search (0.8s)
- Best for complex queries: Agentic (94% accuracy)

GitHub: [link]

Happy to answer any questions about architecture choices or implementation details!
```

### r/LangChain

**Title:** Complete RAG Architecture Guide - 6 patterns with working code

```
Created a comprehensive RAG reference covering everything from basic hybrid search to advanced agentic patterns.

Uses LangChain where appropriate, but also shows direct implementations for learning.

Includes comparisons so you know which architecture to choose.

What architectures are you all using in production?

## 🟠 Hacker News Strategy

### Optimal Posting

- **Time:** Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-12pm EST
- **Title format:** "Show HN: Awesome RAG Architectures 2025 – 6 production patterns with code"

### Launch Post

```
Show HN: Awesome RAG Architectures 2025 – 6 production patterns with code

After building RAG systems for 2 years, I open-sourced a comprehensive guide covering the architectures that actually work in production.

Key insight: There's no one-size-fits-all RAG. The right choice depends on your use case:
- Simple Q&A → Hybrid Search
- Complex reasoning → Multi-Hop or Agentic
- Full document context → Long-Context
- Entity relationships → Knowledge Graph

Each architecture has working Python code, notebooks, and benchmarks.
